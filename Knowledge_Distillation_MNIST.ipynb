    "# Knowledge Distillation on MNIST\n",
    "Knowledge distillation is the process of transferring the higher performance of a more expensive model to a smaller one.  In this notebook, we will explore performing this process on MNIST.  To begin with, I have provided access to pre-trained model that is large, but performant.  The exact architecture is not relevant (although you can inspect this easily if you wish).  It is straightforward to load in pytorch with"
